        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>I am a Master’s Mechanical engineering student at Saint Louis University, working in haptics and mechatronics engineering. My research focuses on devloping novel wearable haptic systems to elicit effective and calming non-visual guided breathing. 
I specialize in interfacing mechanical systems to neurological and sensory stimulation based on user testing and device constraints. 
Furthermore, I collaborate on medical technologies which improve the efficacy of external ventrical drains through controllable mechanical aggitations. </p>

<p>
Beyond my primary research, I perform an active role as in manufacturing engineering for the St. Louis Lighthouse for the Blind along with undergraduate mentorship in our lab. Additionally, I have 
two years as a full-time Division I baseball athlete and am a recipient of multiple engineering scholarships.  </p>

            <h3>Wearable Haptic Integrated Mindfulness System (WHIMS)</h3>

            <p> As a research assistant at SLU’s CHROME Lab I was tasked with developing benchtop testing modules for multiple modalities of haptic sensations. 
                This aimed at interfacing mechanical systems to neurological and sensory stimulation. 
                Initially the project began with multiple modular systems testing radial expansion, linear skin drag, vibration and discrete pressure. 
                After user testing, the next step was to develop a wearable from successful haptic sensations, namely linear skin drag and radial expansion. 
                Pictured above is a current prototype that uses linear skin drag as the haptic communication. 
                To achieve quantifiable and repeatable results, the microcontroller is paired with an encoded micro-DC motor. 
                The program run was written in the Arduino IDE and utilizes a PID library for speed control of the tactor. 
                Ultimately, these devices are to be paired with programed biosensors and guided breathing practices for anxiety reduction in applicable population groups.</p>

            <p> Furthermore, within the scope of my work in the CHROME Lab has been optimizing puck durability for Blind Ice Hockey. 
                My work centered on balancing the sensitive acoustic properties of the current league standard puck (LSP) and its durability challenges. 
                Although electronic replacements for the sheet metal LSP have been pursued, the magnitude of impacts and harsh conditions of the ice rink left many electronic replacements impractical. 
                Therefore, an additive measure to the highly touted LSP was the focus of my work. Research was based on deformation and adaptive structure of 3D printed TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane). 
                Testing was conducted based on variations in primary variables such as ring tightness, location and number of contact points. 
                Ultimately, frequency analysis in MATLAB revealed that certain parameters were more effective at maximizing the “white noise” that the puck produces. 
                Maintaining the “white noise” and loudness of the puck is essential for visually impaired players to localize the LSP during play. 
                Based on our findings, I produced numerous design iterations to maximize the acoustic profile of the combination LSP and cage. 
                Furthermore, I have incorporated electro-mechanical systems that can sense when the puck stops during play and can produce an additional sound to allow players to localize the puck. 
                This prevents “dead time” during practice and games and minimizes stoppages. </p>

            <p>My work with the Infrared Photogate for Sickle Cell Confirmation is in conjunction with a medical team in Saint Louis University’s Doisy College of Health Sciences. 
                A team and myself are producing an integrated stand and sensors capable of timing blood decents in a tust tube of copper sulfate solution. 
                The automized testing process for Sickle Cell anemia increases the rate of data collection and decreases costs associated with training and maintaining staff in developing nations. 
                Moreover, an integrated a cost-effective method of data collection provides a quantatative method of diagnosing patients and approving blood donations. 
                The biggest limitations surrounding this project are the costs associated with testing, on-site facilities and durability of a remote product. 
                To automize the timing process a set of infrared (IR) photogates was used on each test tube. This utilized IR LEDs and recievers set in series with a signal amplifier for better data resolution. 
                The stand was designed to be manufactured on site by local carpenters in a fashion that could easily be reproduced and could accommodate sensors and a removable microcontroller system. 
                Currently, this project is in submission for the RICE360 Global Health Technology challenge.</p>
