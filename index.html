        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p> 
            I am a Master’s Mechanical Engineering student in the Collaborative Haptics, Robotics, and Mechatronics (CHROME) Lab at Saint Louis University, specializing in the integration of mechanical actuators, controllers, and sensors.
            I currently research novel, wearable haptic systems that elicit clear and calming touch feedback for non-visual guided breathing through vibration, skin drag, and pressure sensations. 
            In addition to haptics, I work on the development of medical devices and manufacturing systems with external partners in the St. Louis region. 
            Beyond my current engineering work, I mentor undergraduate and high school volunteers in our lab to help them develop experience in engineering research and mechatronics.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my undergraduate studies at Saint Louis University, I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and competed as a Division I baseball athlete. 
            During this time, I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant on an additively manufactured puck enclosure for blind ice hockey. 
            Additionally, I interned at Regal Boats, where I contributed to the design and integration of yacht systems and performed CFD analysis on hull porpoising behavior.</p>

                Haptics, the science and technology of touch, has demonstrated strong potential for communication, accessibility, and well-being by leveraging the multidimensional and intuitive nature of the touch channel. 
                While guided breathing is commonly supported through visual, auditory, or cognitive cues, touch remains underutilized despite its established connection to calming and parasympathetic responses. 
                This work investigates wearable haptic stimuli for guided breathing by developing six distinct prototypes, conducting two user studies, and presenting design guidelines for intuitive, non-visual, and calming haptic breathing systems.

                Blind ice hockey is an adapted version of ice hockey for athletes with visual impairments that uses a specially designed puck containing metal bearings to produce sound, allowing players to track and control it through auditory cues.
                While the puck is very effective at emmiting sound at a high volume and across a broad range of frequencies, this relies on it being manufactured from thin sheet metal. 
                Therefore, our project in the CHROME Lab worked to optimize puck durability while maintaing it's natural sound and playing charecteristics for Blind Ice Hockey. 
                Although electronic replacements for the sheet metal LSP have been pursued, the magnitude of impacts and harsh conditions of the ice rink left many electronic replacements impractical. 
                Therefore, we pursued the development of adaptive structure made from 3D printed TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane). 
                Ultimately, I helped conduct sound testing and frequency analysis in MATLAB to reveal optimal design parameters such as ring tightness, location and number of contact points. 
                Based on our findings, I produced design iterations to maximize the acoustic profile of the combination LSP and cage. 
                Furthermore, I have incorporated electro-mechanical systems that can sense when the puck stops during play and can produce an additional sound to allow players to localize the puck. 
                This prevents “dead time” during practice and games and minimizes stoppages. 
                More recently, I have mentored and managed undergratuate and highschool volunteers in this pursuit of developing an electromechanical noise emmiter and radio frequency controller.

                Creating accessible job opportunities requires thoughtful adaptation of tools, workflows, and technologies so that employees of all abilities can perform their roles effectively and independently. 
                My role as a manufacturing engineer fellow has involved a number of engineering projects which have improved accessibility in the St. Louis Lighthouse for the Blind plant.

                    <li>I developed an auxiliary audio system for digital scales to provide precise, non-visual measurement feedback.</li>
                    <li>I implemented an alignment-detection warning system that trigger an audible alarm when filling mechanisms and canisters are misaligned, preventing fluid spills and reducing operational errors.</li>
                    <li>I coordinated with equipment manufacturers to acquire specialized parts that reduced production delays and defect rates.</li>

                External ventricular drains (EVDs) are critical for controlling intracranial pressure in neurologic intensive care, but catheter obstruction from biological and cellular debris remains a common complication. 
                To this end, I worked on developmen and testing a Vibration Obstruction Prevention (VOP) system, an externally attached mechanical agitator for existing EVD treatments. 
                On this system, I performed benchtop vibration characterization using laser Doppler vibrometry as well as clinically inspired occlusion testing which demonstrated that mechanical agitation improved catheter patency. 
                Additionally, results discovered the optimal placement of the vibration unit to minimize vibration propagation to the insertion site, supporting the VOP system as a promising and easy-to-use approach for improving EVD patency.

                This work on an Infrared Photogate system for Sickle Cell confirmation was conducted in collaboration with a medical team at Saint Louis University’s Doisy College of Health Sciences. 
                The project involved designing an integrated stand and infrared sensor system to automate the timing of blood descent in a test tube containing copper sulfate solution. 
                By replacing manual observation, the automated process increases data collection rates, reduces training and staffing costs, and enables quantitative diagnosis and blood donation screening in developing regions. 
                The system was designed for low cost, durability, and local manufacturability, with a stand reproducible by on-site carpenters and a removable microcontroller and sensor assembly. 
                Additionally, a multiphase CFD sensitivity study of droplet descent was performed in OpenFOAM to verify alignment effects of the tube.

                As a mechanical engineering intern at Regal Boats, I designed and installed propulsion, plumbing, and electrical systems for yacht manufacturing.
                In this role, I also preformed CFD analysis and validation on hull designs for running characteristics and excitation responses which induce hull porpoising.  
                Furthermore, I analyzed propulsion and propellor performance using numerical methods and artificial neural networks to match running charecterstics, such as Volumetric Froude Number, to optimal propellor selection.
